== Post deployment steps
* Now that you have completed your Liquibase Pro setup for AWS, you can quickly and safely make changes to your database using Liquibase.
* The easiest way to see this in action is to simply create a new SQL file in a sqlfiles directory in the repository. Simply clone the CodeCommit repository to your local machine. Then, create a directory named sqlfiles. Then add a file like the following to that directory. Finally, git commit ... and git push.

-- liquibase formatted sql 
--changeset AmyS:createTable_new_table_01
CREATE TABLE new_table_01 (
   ID int NOT NULL,
   NAME varchar(20) NULL,
   REGION varchar(20) NULL,
   MARKET varchar(20) NULL
)
You will then see a new CodePipeline execution triggered.
