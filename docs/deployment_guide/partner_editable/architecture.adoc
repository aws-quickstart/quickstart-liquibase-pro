Deploy this Quick Start for a new {partner-product-name} pipeline with deployments to three AWS RDS PostgreSQL databases. Choose between using an existing virtual private cloud (VPC) or creating a new VPC. The pipeline includes an AWS CodePipeline with AWS CodeBuild Stages and approval gates to deploy a series of scripts using {partner-product-name}.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive information, such as database user names, passwords, and the {partner-product-short-name} license key.
* AWS CodeCommit to store and manage database scripts.
* Amazon EventBridge to invoke new builds when the main branch is updated in the AWS CodeCommit repository.
* AWS CodePipeline to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software.
* AWS CodeBuild to compile source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for storing artifacts and logs for auditing purposes.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* Inside the VPC, three Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) PostgreSQL databases for testing, staging, and production environments.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
