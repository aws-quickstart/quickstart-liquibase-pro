Deploy this Quick Start for a new {partner-product-name} pipeline with deployments to three AWS RDS PostgreSQL databases. Choose between using an existing virtual private cloud (VPC) or creating a new VPC. The pipeline includes an AWS CodePipeline with AWS CodeBuild Stages and approval gates to deploy a series of scripts using {partner-product-name}.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A code repository to house database scripts.
* Secrets to store sensitive information such as database username and passwords and the {partner-product-short-name} license key.
* An AWS CodePipeline with CodeBuild stages for Test, Staging, and Production environments.
** Installation of {partner-product-short-name} into CodeBuild using a docker image.
** CloudWatch events to monitor changes to the code repository and to trigger new builds.
** Approval gates where changes can be approved prior to deployment to Staging and Production environments.
* Three AWS RDS PostgreSQL databases for use as the Test, Staging, and Production environments.
* An Amazon S3 bucket used for storing artifacts and logs for auditing purposes.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
