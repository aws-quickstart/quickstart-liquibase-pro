If the CloudFormation stack fails to delete the LambdaSecurityGroup resource when you no longer need the resources deployed by this Quick Start, this is likely because the AWS Lambda Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is still attached to the security group. This ENI is used by the Lambda Function that CodeBuild creates for communicating with the RDS databases, and the issue usually occurs if the CloudFormation stack is deleted while a CodePipeline job is incomplete, such as an incomplete manual approval step. If this occurs, please do the following:

* Go to the Network interfaces section of the Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) console.
* Enter the security group ID (eg: sg-01234567) for the LambdaSecurityGroup resource in the Filter network interfaces search field at the top of the page.
* Click the checkbox next to the ENI to select it.

NOTE: The filtered results should list only one ENI with this security group attached.

* Click the Actions drop-down button at the top-right and select Change security groups.
* In the Change security groups page, click the remove button next to the security group that matches the LambdaSecurityGroup resource ID, and then click the Save button at the bottom.

NOTE: There should be only one attached security group for this ENI.

* Go back to the CloudFormation console and delete the CloudFormation stack again, which should successfully delete the LambdaSecurityGroup resource this time and complete the stack delete operation.
** If desired, go back to the Amazon EC2 console afterward and delete the ENI.
