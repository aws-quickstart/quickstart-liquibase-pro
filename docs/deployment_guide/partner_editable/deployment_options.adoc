This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC]. This option deploys {partner-product-short-name} into a new AWS environment consisting of a VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, CodeCommit repository, Secrets Manager secrets, CodePipeline with CodeBuild stages installed with {partner-product-name}, three Amazon RDS PostgreSQL databases, and other infrastructure components. All infrastructure components with private networking requirements are deployed within this new VPC.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC]. This option deploys {partner-product-short-name} into an AWS environment consisting of an CodeCommit repository, Secrets Manager secrets, CodePipeline with CodeBuild stages installed with {partner-product-short-name}, three Amazon RDS PostgreSQL databases, and other infrastructure components. All infrastructure with private networking requirements are deployed within your existing VPC.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these two options. You can also configure the Amazon RDS PostgreSQL engine version, instance class, allocated storage, storage type, port, usernames and passwords, and backup retention period for the databases used by the {partner-product-short-name} pipeline.
